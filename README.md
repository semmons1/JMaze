# JMaze
This is a simple puzzle/tile game that was developed as a project for Software Design, UW-COSC 3011. It utilizes the Java Swing library, and the Java AWT library, along with generic collections, and other standard OOP libraries. The code itself is well documented, and explains the thought process of almost every code block/design decision that was made.
# Set Up and Run
Make sure that you have Java 13 (oracle, not openJDK), installed on your machine. Make sure that your PATH is updated appropriately.
`git clone`, or download this zip of this repository. `cd` into the directory "JMaze", and `cd` into the "src" folder. Run the following command:<br/>
`javac *.java`, this will allow the JVM to compile all .java source files at once. Now run `java Main`, and the game should pop up in a new window. From here, you can start playing the game. Have fun! :rocket:
